This was an assignment for a graduate computational analysis course. The goal of the first part of this assignment was to fit a line to a simple data set by hand-coding a metropolis algorithm. The second part of this assignment looked at a subset of the Gia catalogue, removed stars that did not belong to the main star cluster, and used a metropolis algorithm to fit a line to the cluster.
