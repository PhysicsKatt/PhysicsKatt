This was an assignment completed as part of my MS program. We were asked to create ray tracing matrices and plot the results to reproduce figures from the book “Fundamentals of Photonics” by Saleh and Teich. The figures investigated transmission and reflection through different optical systems, and the code used to reproduce each figure is labeled according to which figure from the text is being reproduced.
