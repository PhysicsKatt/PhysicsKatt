Hello world :) My name is Katherine, but I go by Kat. I have a BS in physics with a minor in math from the University of Oregon, and I am currently an MS 
candidate in applied physics with a focus on optics from the University of Oregon. I am a computational physicist, and my passions are data analyis 
and light. As an undergraduate I worked in computational neuroscience studying the auditory cortex, and as a post-bac I worked in high energy physics 
optimizing the Gloabl Tau Trigger for CERN's ATLAS project. I am currently applying to industrial internships to complete my MS where I hope to work 
in quantum optics or building microscopes.
