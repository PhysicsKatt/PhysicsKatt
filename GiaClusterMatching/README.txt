This was an assignment for a graduate computational analysis course at the University of Oregon. 
This project looked at stars from the Gia catalogue and cross-matched them to stars known to belong 
to the NGC6397 cluster by training different neural nets and comparing their classification efficiency.
Using the NN with the highest classification efficiency, the assignment then explored how the stars that 
were classified as NGC6397 were spatially oriented along a known isochrone of the Gia cluster. Misclassified 
stars were examined, and THE viability of new cluster candidates was determined.
